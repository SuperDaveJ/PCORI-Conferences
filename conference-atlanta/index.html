                    <p>PCORI is looking for research that provides new knowledge focused on helping patients and stakeholders make critical choices. This research is not just used as a tool to guide decisions, but is delivered directly to defined patient populations. In this session PCORI will discuss the key features of funded Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) and the merit review criteria. We will also talk about broad as well as targeted APDTO PCORI Funding Announcements, the future of the priority area, funded research areas, and the areas in which the program seeks to fill in gaps.</p>

                    <p>The priority area Improving Healthcare Systems seeks to fund studies comparing the effectiveness of alternate approaches that healthcare systems can take to increase efficiency, access to care, and quality, in order to improve outcomes among the patients they serve. In this session, you will find out the specific program areas and distinct aspects of the IHS program. This session will give participants an overview of PCORI’s IHS funded research, information on what PCORI is looking for in your Letter of Intent (LOI), and common mistakes to avoid when submitting an LOI and an application. PCORI will also provide insight into the IHS research prioritization criteria.</p>

In this session, participants will find out what type of research PCORI is interested in funding that will help the healthcare community communicate their findings and facilitate the use of new evidence and tools. PCORI will discuss what they are looking for in projects that address critical knowledge gaps in the communication and dissemination process.

                    <p>The Eugene Washington PCORI Engagement Awards, named in honor of the first chair of PCORI’s Board of Governors, encourage active integration of patients, caregivers, clinicians, and other healthcare stakeholders as integral members of the research process. The program provides a platform to expand the role of all stakeholders involved in research supporting PCORI’s Engagement imperative. The Pipeline to Proposal Awards Initiative is a three-tiered funding approach that aims to accelerate research proposal submission and dissemination and develop a nationwide foundation of patients, stakeholders, and researchers equipped and eager to participate in PCOR. Furthermore, Pipeline Awards are intended for those individuals or groups who are not usual candidates for research funding. These dollars are targeted at those individuals and groups with critically important ideas who may not have other opportunities for research funding. During this session, participants will get an overview of the Eugene Washington PCORI Engagement and the three types of Pipeline to Proposal funding opportunities. PCORI will also explain the LOI evaluation criteria.</p>

                    <h2>Improving Healthcare Systems (IHS)</h2><p></p>
                    <p>The priority area Improving Healthcare Systems seeks to fund studies comparing the effectiveness of alternate approaches that healthcare systems can take to increase efficiency, access to care, and quality, in order to improve outcomes among the patients they serve. In this session, you will find out the specific program areas and distinct aspects of the IHS program. This session will give participants an overview of PCORI’s IHS funded research, information on what PCORI is looking for in your Letter of Intent (LOI), and common mistakes to avoid when submitting an LOI and an application. PCORI will also provide insight into the IHS research prioritization criteria.</p>

                    <p>Under our CDR priority, we aim to fund projects that address knowledge gaps in how to communicate and disseminate research findings most effectively. In this session, participants will find out what type of research PCORI is interested in funding that will help the healthcare community communicate their findings and facilitate the use of new evidence and tools. PCORI will discuss what they are looking for in projects that address critical knowledge gaps in the communication and dissemination process.

                    <h2>Addressing Disparities (AD)</h2><p></p>
                    <p>Every day, clinicians, healthcare organizations and providers, policy makers, and others are faced with the challenge of eliminating pervasive disparities in health and health care. Previous research has described those disparities and identified potential sources. PCORI seeks to fund research that instead compares evidence-based interventions to reduce or eliminate disparities in patient-centered health outcomes. This session will provide details about the AD program’s mission, goals driver model, and key features of funded research. PCORI team members will give insight into what they’re looking for in your LOI and what makes a strong application.</p>

                    <p>How a research study is designed and conducted is critically important in determining the value of the finding to patients and other stakeholders in making healthcare decisions. One of our mandates is to improve how patient-centered clinical research is conducted and to improve the infrastructure available for conducting such studies. Under our research methods priority, we are interested in supporting studies that foster methodological advances in PCOR. In this session, attendees will learn about the mission and objectives of the Accelerating Patient-Centered Outcomes Research and Methodological Research program and the research topics they are looking to fund. Participants will also be given an overview of PCORI’s vision for their Methods program.</p>

              <p>PCORI funds large Pragmatic Clinical Studies that compare two or more alternatives for addressing prevention, diagnosis, treatment, or management of a disease or symptom; improving healthcare system-level approaches to managing care; or eliminating health or healthcare disparities. Compared with typical clinical trials, protocols for these studies are often less complex and less intrusive to routine clinical practice. These studies involve broadly representative patient populations and are large enough to provide precise estimates of hypothesized differences in effectiveness and support evaluation of potential differences in patient subgroups.</p>
              <p>In this interactive session, invited participants will gain insight on how PCORI conceptualizes large clinical effectiveness research studies and tips and strategies about the application process.

                    <h2>Overview of Engagement Funding Opportunities</h2><p></p>
                    <p>The Eugene Washington PCORI Engagement Awards, named in honor of the first chair of PCORI’s Board of Governors, encourage active integration of patients, caregivers, clinicians, and other healthcare stakeholders as integral members of the research process. The program provides a platform to expand the role of all stakeholders involved in research supporting PCORI’s Engagement imperative. The Pipeline to Proposal Awards Initiative is a three-tiered funding approach that aims to accelerate research proposal submission and dissemination and develop a nationwide foundation of patients, stakeholders, and researchers equipped and eager to participate in PCOR. Furthermore, Pipeline Awards are intended for those individuals or groups who are not usual candidates for research funding. These dollars are targeted at those individuals and groups with critically important ideas who may not have other opportunities for research funding. During this session, participants will get an overview of the Eugene Washington PCORI Engagement and the three types of Pipeline to Proposal funding opportunities. PCORI will also explain the LOI evaluation criteria.</p>

                    <p>PCORI’s authorizing law requires us to peer review all of our primary research and disseminate the results to patients, clinicians, and the general public. Our Board of Governors has recently approved the peer review process, and we’ll be working closely with our awardees to implement this process as our first primary CER studies are published. This is part of PCORI’s comprehensive effort to disseminate the results of our funded studies and ensure that they are implemented broadly in practice. In this session, PCORI staff will outline our plans for the peer review and public release of our research results, answer questions about what this means for our awardees, and discuss how we’ll be working together to make it successful.</p>
